# UnityScripts

This is a bunch of Unity 2D C# scripts I’ve written while learning game development.  
I keep them here so I can reuse them later or share them with others who might find them helpful.

## What’s Inside
- **Player Movement** *(Note: remember to adjust Ground Check Distance in Collision Details to your object)*
- **Player Movement with double jump** *(same as Player Movement but with double jump mechanic)*
- **Camera Follow** *(Remember to attach the script to the camera and place Player Object in target. Also offset z should be negative)*

## Why I Made This
To have all useful Unity scripts in one place. It's also a way to track my own progress. I'll keep adding new stuff as I learn more.

## How To Use
1. Download or copy a script you need.
2. Drop it into your Unity project.
3. Attach it to an object in your scene.
4. Adjust the variables.
